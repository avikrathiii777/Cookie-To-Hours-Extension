🍪 Cookie to Hours Planner

This is a small Chrome extension I built to help me and others stay consistent with coding.

Instead of just saying “I’ll code more”, I wanted something that:

turns effort into a number,

gives me a daily target,

and gently reminds me if I’m falling behind.

That’s how the cookie → hours idea came up.

🌱 The Idea

I start by choosing how serious my project is:

Functional projects need more time

Intermediate projects need balanced effort

Very good projects need focused, high-quality work

I then enter a number of cookies (just a fun unit), and the extension converts it into total coding hours.
Those hours are spread evenly until 29 March, so I always know what I should aim for each day.

⏱️ How I Use It Daily

Every day, I open the extension and log how long I coded:

+1 Hour when I’ve done a solid session

+10 Minutes for short bursts

Before saving, I can:

Undo a mistake

Confirm when I’m sure

Reset the day if something went wrong

The extension then tells me whether I’m:

✅ ahead

⚠️ behind

➖ on track

No pressure — just clarity.

✨ What It Does

Converts cookies into target coding hours

Calculates daily goals automatically

Tracks time in hours and minutes (no decimals)

Stores everything locally in the browser

Works offline

Keeps things simple and distraction-free

🚀 Why I Made This

I wanted a tool that feels more like a quiet companion than a strict tracker.

Something that:

nudges me forward,

forgives missed days,

and helps me build consistency over time.

🌼 Possible Improvements

If I keep working on this, I’d love to add:

a progress bar,

weekly summaries,

streak tracking,

smarter daily adjustments.

Thanks for checking it out 😊
If this helps you code a little more consistently, then it’s done its job.
I think it would be very useful for everyone in flavortown.
